# Real_Time_Object_Detection
This project uses a Raspberri pi 3 with a logitech web camera scanning and transmitting live video using python flask . The video is first processed in realtime for objects. The purpose is to try using Spark , Tensorflow and Yolo

Python Server program can send a photo or send live footage taken from the camera. This resides on the server machine.

We go to the URL from the desktop . The output sent by the server to our browser can be taken as input for our Detection program.
